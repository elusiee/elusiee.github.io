    "bio": "Hello, I’m Emmanuel Elusie — a Backend Software Engineer, Author, and Critical Thinker dedicated to building systems that are both technically sound and intellectually intentional.\n\nI am a self-taught developer with intensive bootcamp training from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO), where I completed over 1200+ hours of hands-on coding and 100+ hours of professional development training. My expertise lies in designing scalable backend systems, building APIs, and solving complex problems with clean, maintainable architecture.\n\nMy technical stack includes:\n\nJava | Spring Boot | MongoDB | SQL | Python | JavaScript | TypeScript | C/C++ | Dart\n\nBeyond software engineering, I am also a published author of both fiction and non-fiction, with a strong inclination toward analytical reasoning, critical thinking, and free inquiry. This intellectual foundation shapes how I approach technology — not just as code, but as systems that impact people, society, and the future.\n\nI thrive in challenging environments where innovation, clarity of thought, and technical precision are valued. My goal is to contribute to forward-thinking teams by building reliable, secure, and scalable solutions that solve real-world problems.",
